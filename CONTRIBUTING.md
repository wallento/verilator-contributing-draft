## How to contribute to Verilator

Thanks for using Verilator!  We welcome your contributions in whatever form.

This contributing document contains some suggestions that may make contributions flow more efficiently.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching [Verilator Issues](https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new issue](https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/issues/new).
  * Be sure to include a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
  * The ideal example works against other simulators, and is in the test_regress/t test format, as described in <<FIXME-internals.md>>.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a [open a new issue](https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/issues/new).

* You may attach a patch, or (preferred) may point to a github repository branch within your github account.

* If you have not contributed previously, your patch must include adding your name to docs/CONTRIBUTIORS.  This certifies your contributions are open source, under the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).
