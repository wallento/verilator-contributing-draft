## How to contribute to Verilator

Thanks for using Verilator!  We welcome your contributions in whatever form.

This contributing document contains some suggestions that may make contributions flow more efficiently.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching [Verilator Issues](https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new issue](https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/issues/new).
  * Be sure to include a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
  * The ideal example works against other simulators, and is in the test_regress/t test format, as described in <<FIXME-internals.md>>.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a [open a new issue](https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/issues/new).

* You may attach a patch, or (preferred) may point to a github repository branch within your github account.

* Your contributions must be certified as open source, under the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/). On your first contribution, you must either:
  * Have your patch include the addition of your name to docs/CONTRIBUTORS (preferred).
  * Use "git -s" as part of your commit. This adds a "signed-of-by" attribute which will certify your contribution as described in the [Signed-of-By convention](https://github.com/wking/signed-off-by/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches).
  * Email or post in an issue a statement that you certify your contributions.
  * In any of these cases your name will be added to docs/CONTRIBUTORS and you are agreeing all future contributions are also certified.

* Most important is we get your patch. If you'd like to clean up indentation and related issues ahead of our feedback, that is apprciated. Please see the coding conventions in <<fixme-internals.md>>.

#### **Do you have questions?**

* Please see the [Verilator FAQ](https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/wiki/Faq).

* Ask any question in the [Verilator forums](https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/boards).

#### **Code of Conduct**

* Our contributors and participants pledge to make participation in our project and our community a positive experience for everyone.  We follow the [Contributor Covenant version 1.4](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html).

Thanks!
